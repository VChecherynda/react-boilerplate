##Libraries

In this project use such libraries:
  -redux-saga     ( middleware for async requests)
  -react-redux    ( middleware for state managment)
  -redux-actions  ( for easier usage actions with redux )
  -redux-persist  ( for easier usage localstorage )
  -react-router   ( for routing into the project )

##.env variables

We have 3 different enviroment variables (.env / .env.development / .env.production). Default 
[.env] and [.env.development] using for localhost. The params will be the same. But if you need you custom
properties you should overwrite it in the [.env.development]. When you build all params will heve taken from the [.env.production]
